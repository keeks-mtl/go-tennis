### Design Choices

- The site is based around tennis and the particular logo for the site. 
- The site itself needed to be easy to navigate, provide information users would find beneficial, and display said information in a way that is visually appealing. 
- The overall design choice created a space that was malleable and gave space for an ecommerce functionality.   
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create the wireframes and organise how the site flowed. 
- Balsamiq also helped visualise how the different pages would look on different screen sizes. 
- Once the project was built following the planning stages, there were ways that the design changed while building the site. Because my background isn't in design, it is hard to come up with something that appeals visually from a blank slate. The design process was an evolving process that required tweeks and changes to improve Go-Tennis and create something that looked appeasing. 

### Fonts

- The goal was to have a crisp and modern feel with a bit of punch. 
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to find a font that had the right feel for Go-Tennis. The font chosen was 'Lara'. 'Lara' is a well balanced contemporary serif which is optimised for screen performance. 

### Icons

- Go-Tennis takes advantage of iconography by utilizing icons from [Font Awesome](www.fontawesome.com).
- The top three buttons on the navbar use icons to give a clear visual cue to solidify what the buttons do (search, account, and shopping bag). 
- The icons made the content more concise and didn't distract from the information.
- An important icon used, is the hamburger icon that will make navigation more simple on mobile devices.
- Social media icons are also used to give clear indication of how to follow Go-Tennis on social media.
- The logo and favicon was chosen for it's simple representation of tennis. 

### Colours

- The colour theme included six main colours that complimented one another.
- The colours were chosen because of their contrast and they way they complimented the logo.
- The colours felt appropriate because of the way they went with the logo and the main photo on the homepage.  

<div align="center"><img src="readme-images/color-theme.png" alt="image of the go-tennis color theme"></div>

- #fffce6 Beige
    - A soft beige colour to be used instead of white for a nice neutral light colour
- #c2b8ad Pale Silver
    - Another neutral colour to be used for things that shouldn't garner too much attention like back and cancel buttons. 
- #a3cdd9 Light Blue
    - The main colour of Go-Tennis. This shade of light blue is the dominant colour and can be seen all around the site. 
- #3f596e Black Coral
    - A darker blue used as a bit of contrast to the main blue of the site. Mostly used around the light blue where using more light blue would be overpowering. 
- #d39e00 Goldenrod
    - A pop of colour for things that are meant to stand out like the stars on the comment page.
